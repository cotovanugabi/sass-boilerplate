// Generally, a Layout style only has a single selector: 
// a single ID or class name. However, there are times when a 
// Layout needs to respond to different factors. For example, you may 
// have different layouts based on user preference. 
// This layout preference would still be declared as a 
// Layout style and used in combination with other Layout styles.
